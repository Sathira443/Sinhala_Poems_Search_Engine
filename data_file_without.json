Two of the legs of the base were not completely formed, so there was no way to insert the casters. I unpackaged the entire chair and hardware before noticing this. So, I'll spend twice the amount of time boxing up the whole useless thing and send it back with a 1-star review of part of a chair I never got to sit in. I will go so far as to include a picture of what their injection molding and quality assurance process missed though. I will be hesitant to buy again. It makes me wonder if there aren't missing structures and supports that don't impede the assembly process.", "review_title": "I'll spend twice the amount of time boxing up the whole useless thing and send it back with a 1-star review ...", "language": "sin", "product_category": "furniture", "published_date": "10/03/2022"}
